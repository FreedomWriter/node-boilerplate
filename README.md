My notes on the steps I take to create a Web API Server and database using:

- express
- cors
- morgan
- helmet
- sqlite3
- dotenv
- knex
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken

With additional notes on Sessions using

- express-session

I'm a noob so if you see something I missed or something I should be looking deeper into, let me know!

UPDATE: Adding notes on a deeper dive into SQL and broad level database management. These can be found in the SQL directory.
