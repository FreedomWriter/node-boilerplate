# Aggregate functions

In database management an aggregate function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input on certain criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning.

Some common examples:

- AVG() -- calculates the average of a set of values.
- COUNT() -- counts rows in a specified table or view.
- MIN() -- gets the minimum value in a set of values.
- MAX() -- gets the maximum value in a set of values.
- SUM() -- calculates the sum of values.
